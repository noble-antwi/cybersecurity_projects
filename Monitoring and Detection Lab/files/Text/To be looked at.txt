Expanding on the previous explanation, if you're using **pfSense** and want to send traffic from **LAN1** (where your two workstations and server are) to **Security Onion** on **LAN2**, while using a SPAN port, here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Network Setup Overview**:
- **LAN1**: Contains your two workstations and a server.
- **LAN2**: Hosts your **Security Onion** instance, which will be analyzing the network traffic.
- **pfSense**: Your firewall/router, which you configure to mirror traffic from LAN1 to LAN2 (where Security Onion is located).

### 2. **Steps to Mirror Traffic from LAN1 to LAN2 (Security Onion)**:

#### **1. Set up the SPAN (Mirror) Port on pfSense:**
- In pfSense, configure the SPAN port on **LAN1**. Let’s assume the traffic from the two workstations and server on LAN1 should be monitored.
- The SPAN port will be configured to **copy all traffic from LAN1 ports** to a designated port (let’s call this Port X) where **Security Onion** can receive it for analysis.

#### **2. Mirror LAN1 Traffic:**
- You'll configure the pfSense firewall to mirror traffic from the **LAN1 interface** to another interface (or port) on pfSense that is connected to **LAN2**, where Security Onion resides.
- Essentially, you’re telling pfSense: “Take everything that happens on LAN1 and copy it to LAN2.”
  
#### **3. Send Traffic to Security Onion on LAN2**:
- Once the SPAN port is configured to mirror traffic from LAN1, pfSense will send the **mirrored (copied) traffic** to LAN2, where your Security Onion is connected.
- **Security Onion**, which is a network security monitoring (NSM) and intrusion detection system (IDS), will then capture, inspect, and analyze the traffic coming from LAN1.

### **How the Flow Works:**
- **Workstations and server on LAN1** communicate normally (e.g., sending/receiving data across the network).
- The SPAN port on pfSense will **copy all this traffic** (both incoming and outgoing data from LAN1).
- The copied traffic is sent to the **LAN2 network**, where **Security Onion** is set up.
- **Security Onion** will receive this traffic on its monitoring interface and start performing deep packet inspection, log analysis, and security monitoring on it.

### **Visual Representation**:

```
LAN1 (Workstations & Server) --> pfSense (SPAN Port) --> LAN2 (Security Onion)
```

### **Security Onion Role**:
- **Traffic Analysis**: Security Onion will analyze the mirrored traffic for potential threats, anomalies, or suspicious activity.
- **IDS/IPS**: It uses tools like **Snort**, **Suricata**, or **Zeek** to detect intrusions or malicious behavior in the network traffic.
- **Network Visibility**: You'll be able to see all the traffic, logs, and alerts from LAN1 in Security Onion's dashboard.

### **Final Overview**:
- The two workstations and server on LAN1 function normally, but every packet of data they send or receive is duplicated by the SPAN port in pfSense and forwarded to LAN2.
- **Security Onion** sitting in LAN2 captures this mirrored traffic for analysis. You can then use Security Onion’s tools to view alerts, logs, or suspicious patterns in the traffic.
  
In summary, you are using the **SPAN port** as a mechanism to copy traffic from **LAN1** and sending it to **Security Onion** on **LAN2** for advanced network monitoring and security analysis.
