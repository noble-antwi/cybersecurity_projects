As part of the setup for this cybersecurity home lab, the primary goal is to simulate real-world scenarios by segmenting the environment into multiple isolated networks. This allows for the creation of distinct zones for attack simulations, monitoring, and defensive operations. Below is a comprehensive overview of the lab’s architecture and network configuration, followed by a detailed explanation of each component, its purpose, and suggested improvements.

### Objectives of the Home Lab

1. **Simulate real-world attacks and defenses**: By creating isolated networks, this lab will allow for the simulation of cybersecurity attacks, defensive measures, and traffic analysis.
2. **Isolate roles across networks**: Network segmentation ensures that attack traffic and victim traffic can be analyzed independently while maintaining a strong boundary between attacker, victim, and monitoring resources.
3. **Implement monitoring tools**: Centralized monitoring solutions like Splunk and Security Onion will provide traffic capture, incident detection, and network visibility across the different segments.
4. **Learn and practice threat detection and response**: The lab will offer an environment to understand how various tools work together in threat detection, network monitoring, and response processes.

Here’s an expanded description of Security Onion and its features, detailing each component and additional tools that enhance the platform’s capabilities. This version includes critical add-ons and optional integrations available with Security Onion for a fully robust security operations environment:

The Hive enhances Security Onion’s capabilities by enabling case management, collaboration, and threat intelligence integration for effective incident handling.

5. **Endpoint Monitoring and Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**:
   - **OSSEC/Wazuh**: Security Onion incorporates either OSSEC or Wazuh, host-based intrusion detection systems that monitor endpoint behaviors. These tools collect data on file integrity, rootkit detection, Windows logon/logoff events, and registry modifications, providing continuous endpoint visibility.
   - **Agent-Based Monitoring**: OSSEC/Wazuh agents monitor endpoint integrity and report critical events back to the server for further analysis, helping to detect and respond to endpoint-based anomalies.

6. **Full Packet Capture and Forensic Analysis**:
   - **NetworkMiner and Wireshark**: Security Onion supports full packet capture, providing forensic capabilities for post-incident analysis. NetworkMiner and Wireshark help examine packet data in detail, assisting in malware analysis, protocol inspection, and timeline reconstruction during incident response.
   - **pcap Storage and Analysis**: Full packet capture capabilities enable long-term storage of network data, supporting in-depth forensic analysis of historical network activity to identify the extent of potential breaches.

7. **Threat Hunting and Automation**:
   - **Sigma and Yara Rules**: Security Onion supports custom rule sets from Sigma (for log event detection) and Yara (for binary and file pattern matching) to enable proactive threat hunting and indicator-based detection.
   - **SOC Analyst Workbench**: The analyst workbench provides utilities for manual and automated analysis workflows, allowing for faster data correlation and threat investigation.

8. **Additional Integrations and Add-ons**:
   - **Moloch (Arkime)**: An open-source, large-scale packet capturing and indexing system that provides the ability to search and visualize packet captures efficiently. Arkime can be integrated with Security Onion to enhance packet data analysis.
   - **FleetDM and Osquery**: For advanced endpoint visibility, integrating FleetDM and Osquery provides powerful querying and monitoring capabilities, allowing security teams to perform queries across multiple endpoints in real time.
   - **Cortex**: Often used in conjunction with The Hive, Cortex enables automated analysis and enrichment of observables (such as IPs, domains, and hashes) against threat intelligence feeds.
   - **Open Threat Exchange (OTX) Integration**: Security Onion can leverage threat intelligence from AlienVault’s OTX, incorporating real-time threat data and correlation capabilities to enhance detection accuracy.

9. **Incident Response and Case Management**:
   - **Playbook Automation**: Automated playbooks can be created to streamline incident response activities, including alerting, threat validation, containment, and escalation.
   - **SOAR Capabilities**: Security Onion can be integrated with Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools for automated response actions, further enhancing incident handling capabilities.

### Summary

## IP Subnet and Interface Mapping for PfSense Virtual Lab

Here's a table in Markdown format based on the information you provided:


| Role      | Interface | Network Adapter | VMNet    |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| WAN       | EM0       | Network Adapter  | VMNet   |
| LAN       | EM1       | Network Adapter 2 | VMNet2   |
| SPAN      | EM2       | Network Adapter 3 | VMNet3   |
| KALI      | EM3       | Network Adapter 4 | VMNet4   |
| SECONION  | EM4       | Network Adapter 5 | VMNet5   |
| SPLUNK    | EM5       | Network Adapter 6 | VMNet6   |


## Installations
1. VMware
2. Windows 10
![Windows10Installed](files/images/001Win10Installed.png)

3. Installations of pfSense
   Per the topology above, the pfsesne will have 6 interfaces which is idicate below.
   The configuration is.

| Network Adapter   | VMNet   |
|-------------------|---------|
| Network Adapter   | NAT     |
| Network Adapter 2 | VMNet2  |
| Network Adapter 3 | VMNet3  |
| Network Adapter 4 | VMNet4  |
| Network Adapter 5 | VMNet5  |
| Network Adapter 6 | VMNet6  |

![VnetConfiguration of pfsense](files/images/002pfSenseVmNetConfiguration.png)

During the installation process, the first interface to show up in order to configure the rest of the interfaces indicated no IP address configuration for WAN (wan) with interface em0.
Further research on my side showed that the WMware NAT servies running ont he host was stoped hence the insatance was not getting the WAN interface IP address which is the IP.
address it will use to access the internet.  A restart of the Service in services resolves th issue.
In th intial IP assigment. th Wan insterface has an IP ADDRESS OF 192.1868.114.10/24  WHICH IS THE FIRST ip i CONFIGURED IN vmware fOR nat TO ASSIGNT O THE FURST INSTANCE IN THE NETWORK..The configuration can be seen below.

![NATSetup](files/images/005NATSetup.png)

![StoppedService](files/images/003NATServiceStopped.png)

![pfSenseConfiguration](files/images/004InitialIPconfigurationofPfSense.png)

This version aligns the content properly for a clean and readable table in Markdown.

### Configuration of pfSense Interfaces

In the image below the interfaces from WAN to em65 have been assisgned
![InterfaceAssignment](files/images/006AssigningINterfaces.png)
After completing th einterface assigment, all the interfaces are now showing as indicated below:

![All Interfaces Showing in pfSense](files/images/007AllInterfacesShowing.png).

The next thing to do is to set IP addresses and then set all of them. STARING WITH THE lan INTERFACES.
In this step however, I have decided to assign each interfaces the last IP in the ranges i will be using.
I also Enabled http on the LAN in order to access the firewall Graphically.
The URL to access the web configurator is *http://192.168.1.254*

| pfSencse Interface | IP Address|DHCP Enabled? | Range of DHCP IP |
|----------- | ----------| -----------|-------------------|
|WAN (em0) | 192.168.114.10 (auto assigned)| Acquired From host | Will Revert|
|LAN (em1) | 192.168.1.254 | Yes | 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.253|
|OPT1 (em2)    | No IP Address configured (used as a Span Port)| Not Required Since it is a Span Port   | Not Required|
|OPT2 (em3) | 192.168.3.254 | Yes | 192.168.3.10 to 192.168.3.253|
|OPT3 (em4) | 192.168.4.254 | Yes | 192.168.4.10 to 192.168.4.253|
|OPT4 (em5) | 192.168.5.254 | Yes | 192.168.5.10 to 192.168.5.253|

Below is the command line interface representation of the assigned IP addresses
![pf Sense Interface IP assignemnts](files/images/008InterfacesSet.png)
As indicated in the table above, the intefcae em2, on th pfsense will be used as a  span port hence no need to assign IP address.

### Creating Firewall Rules with pfSense Web Interface

The Table below will serve as a guide for the set up. The content of the table is an extension from  the one above.

| IP Subnet       | Network Connection | Role   | PfSense Interface | VMware Adapter  |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 192.168.114.0/24 | NAT                | WAN    | em0               | Network Adapter |
| 192.168.1.0/24   | VMNet2             | LAN    | em1               | Network Adapter 2 |
| No IP Address    | VMNet3             | SPAN   | em2               | Network Adapter 3 |
| 192.168.3.0/24   | VMNet4             | KALI   | em3               | Network Adapter 4 |
| 192.168.4.0/24   | VMNet5             | SECONION | em4              | Network Adapter 5 |
| 192.168.5.0/24   | VMNet6             | SPLUNK (192.168.5.0) | em5               | Network Adapter 6 |

Since the pfsense is within the LAN network which is VMNet2, I will put a work station on the same netowrk in order to access the web configurator.
In this case i will use the windows 10 workstation installed earlier. The reserveed IP addresses for the LAN are from, 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.9. Since pfsense have been configured as  DHCP for the lan networkI am expectignt that the windows instance.
will have any IP address from 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.253 and its Gatway will be the LAN IP confifured for the.
pfsense which is 192.168.1.254.

OPening the windows instance indicated to me the instance has been assigned an IP of 192.168.1.10 as can be confirmed from the attached.
image below

![Windows 10 Auto Assigned IP](files/images/009WIn10AtuoAssignedIP.png)

![IP Auto Assigend to the Windows Instance](files/images/010IPAutoAssinged.png)

The web configurator URL as indicated earlier can be assessed via  *http://192.168.1.254*
Entering the URL in windows opens up the web configurator as shown below:

In the first web interface set up

1. Hostnmae = pfsense
2. Domain = biira.com
3. Primary DNS: 8.8.8.8
4. Seconday DNS : 4.4.4.4
   ![DNSSetup](files/images/011DNSPage.png)

5. Time Server was kept as the Default. and time change to US central timezone.
6. ALl setttings on the WAN interface was kep as default apart from the option to ```Block RFC1918 Private Networks``` and  ```Block bogon networks``` which were unchecked.

![WAN Setup](files/images/012WANsetup.png)
7. LAN IP is set tp 192.168.1.254 which is correct hence not need to touch anything there as the configuration from the CLI is correct.
8. Admin Password was changed to a preffered one from the Deaful one of pfsense.

Pfesense reloads after the step above and then comes up with the interface in order to now start the configuration.
![All Insterfaces Loaded](files/images/013COnfiguringAllinterfaces.png)

In order for easy compreheions, i will go ahead and rename the Instrafers from the the Deafult ones  as some do not correspond to the Lab configuration

![Default Names](files/images/014DeaultNaming.png)

Some of the interfacenames have been changed as indicated below

Here’s a table in Markdown format with the headers "Old Name" and "New Name" along with two rows of dummy data:

| Old Name       | New Name        |
|----------------|--------------- |
| OPT1 (em2)     | span           |
| OPT2 (em3)     | Kali           |
| OPT4 (em5)     | SecOnion       |
| OPT5 (em6)     | splunk         |
![New Names](files/images/015NewNames.png)

#### COnfiguring Span

In the Bridges tab, I will then forward all traffic from the LAN port to the SPAN as per the configuraiton

![Lan to Span](files/images/016LantoSpan.png)
![BridgedLanTOSPan](files/images/017DoneBridge.png)

### Creatinf FIrewall Rules

1. On the WAN network I configured traffic to be allowed with no restrictions.
![Wan FIrewall](files/images/018WANFirewall.png)

2. On th LAN, the Default Firewall Rule was deleted and then created a new rule to allow all traffic.
   ![Lan Forwall Rule](files/images/019LanRUle.png)
3. ALl other ports were confirigures the smae way to allow for communication from any port to 

## Installing Kali Linux

Kali Linux has been installed and assigned to VMnet4 interface which will ensure it obtaines IP address in the.
ragne from 192.168.3.0/24 network but it starts from 192.168.3.10.
THe Kali maachine therefore has the IP address of 192.168.3.10 as indicated below. It ill also be reacherable to the interenet through the
pfsense firewall configuration.
![Kali Installaion](files/images/020KaliINstallaiontandIPConfiguration.png)

## Installing Metasplloitable

The installation of this Vulnerable box is places on VMnet2 which is representing the Internal Netowkr or LAN. SInce the pfSense is also working as a DHCP it automatically leases out the next IP after thr one it had already leased to the Windows 10 instance which also fell in the LAN network. The IP address given to the Metasploitable Instance is 192.168.1.11 as can be seen from the Image below:

![Automatic IP Assignment](files/images/022MetaspoitableObtainesIP.png)
Mestappitable has an automatic user name of ```msfadmin``` and and correspingin password or ```msfadmin```.
The Metaspoitable 2 GUI can therefore be accessed at http:192.168.1.11 as indicated below
![Metaspitable2Intarface](files/images/023MetsaplitableGUI.png)

This also gives me the optint o have a graphical interface access to the other components likes the Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA).

![DVWA](files/images/024DVWA.png)

## Installing Ubuntu Server

Per the topology, Ubuntu server which will host the Splunk software will be installed on the 192.168.5.0/24 network whhich is configured to be on Vmnet6
![Ubuntu Server Configuration](files/images/025UbuntuServerNetworkSetup.png)

## Installation of Security Onion

In the setup of Security Onion, I will be using three network adapters namely

1. NAT : Used for the managment
2. Vmnet3 : Mirror Interface.
3. Vmnet5 : will be used to collect the logs collection. 

In the setup, ens160 has been desginated as the Managment Interface.
![MgmtInterface](files/images/026ManagmentIntSecOnion.png)

The Managemnet Interface was then assign a static IP address of 192.168.114.5 which is the IP from the vmnet8 adapter that has the NAT configuration on teh host machine
![Host IP](files/images/027Vmnet8HostIP.png)
![Host IP Second](files/images/028Vment8OnPC.png)
![VM Ware Set up](files/images/029VmwareSetup.png)

The Gateway IP is 192.168.114.2 as indicated below
![Gateway IP Below](files/images/030GatewayNAT.png)

IN the NAT Ocnfiguration i did as can be seen from the images above, The automatic IP assignemtn starts from  192.168.114.10 to  192.168.114.254. The static IPS are from  192.168.114.1- 192.168.114.9. However, the  192.168.114.1 has been assigned to the Hposy PV VMWare network adaptor as shown above whist the  192.168.114.2 is used as the Gateway. This therfore implies that, the available Static IP addresses available to assign are from  192.168.114.3 to  192.168.114.9.

I will hoever assign the  192.168.114.5 to the SecurityOnion Management Interface.

![Mgmt Interface IP Assigned](files/images/031MgntIPAssign.png)

I then set the Default Gateway to 192.168.114.2 as indicated earlier in the NAT configuration and then also set the DNS to *biira.com*
![alt text](files/images/032SecOnio.png)

The URL to access the Security Onion Console (SOC) Interface is https://192.168.114.5/.
The SOC Username as set is noble@biira.com with the password known to myself. Lol

After installation, I ran the ```sudo soup``` command to ensure that my Security Onion instance was up to date with the latest security patches and software enhancements. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the system, as it ensures that all detection tools like Zeek and Suricata are operating with the most current features and protections.

Keeping Security Onion updated with sudo soup helps enhance stability, ensures compatibility with other tools, and fortifies the system against known vulnerabilities—critical aspects in any security-focused environment.

### Configuring Security Onion Web Interface Access: Firewall Rule Adjustments in a Threat Detection Lab

After completing the installation of **Security Onion** in my **Threat Detection and Monitoring Lab** on a VMware virtual machine, I encountered an issue when trying to access the web interface. The management interface for Security Onion was set to the IP address **192.168.114.5**, and I had configured the network using **NAT** to share IPs between the VM and my host machine.

I was able to **ping** the Security Onion instance from my host machine, confirming connectivity, but the web interface was inaccessible when I tried using the same IP address.

#### Investigating the Issue: Services Running but No Web Access

To begin troubleshooting, I checked the status of Security Onion services by running:

```bash
sudo so-status
```

The command confirmed that all services were running as expected, indicating there were no issues preventing the system from functioning properly. Below is an image showing the output, which indicates the system’s health.

![so-status output showing services running](image_placeholder_here)

Since the services were operational, I turned my attention to the firewall configuration.

## Initial Troubleshooting: Firewall Configuration

I suspected that the firewall was blocking access to the web interface. I tried using the **so-allow** command, which typically adds IP addresses to the firewall whitelist. However, **this command was not supported** in the version of Security Onion I was using, which was **2.4.110-20241010**.

To get more insights into the firewall rules, I ran the following command to list the current settings:

```bash
sudo iptables -nvL
```

This gave me a clear view of the firewall rules, confirming that access to the management interface was restricted. The output (image below) showed which IP addresses were currently allowed to communicate with Security Onion.

![iptables output showing firewall rules](image_placeholder_here)

## Solution: Modifying Firewall Rules to Grant Access

To resolve the issue, I needed to modify the firewall rules to allow access from my host machine. I used the **so-firewall** command to include a broader range of IPs temporarily for testing:

```bash
sudo so-firewall includehost analyst 192.168.0.0/16
sudo so-firewall apply
```

After applying the change, I successfully accessed the Security Onion web interface from my **Windows 10 machine** with the IP **192.168.1.10**. The image below shows the Security Onion GUI after gaining access.

![Security Onion GUI accessed](image_placeholder_here)

#### Rethinking Security: Narrowing Access to a Specific IP

While the broad **192.168.0.0/16** range worked, it presented a security risk by allowing too many devices on the network to access the web interface. In a real-world environment, minimizing the attack surface is crucial. To restrict access further, I decided to limit web interface access to just my **host machine** with IP **192.168.114.1**.

### Configuring a More Secure Firewall Rule

I had already configured **Vmnet8 NAT** in VMware to distribute IP addresses from **192.168.114.10** to **192.168.114.254**. The **Security Onion instance** was assigned the static IP **192.168.114.5**, and the NAT gateway was **192.168.114.2**. My host machine had the IP **192.168.114.1**, and I wanted only this IP to access Security Onion.

## Solution: Modifying Firewall Rules to Grant Access via the GUI

To resolve the issue of web interface access, I decided to modify the firewall rules. Instead of using command-line , I opted to adjust the settings via Security Onion's **GUI**.

### Step-by-Step Firewall Modification Using the GUI

I navigated to **Administration > Configuration > Firewall > Hostgroup > Analyst** within the Security Onion interface. I removed the broad range previously set and configured the firewall to allow access only to **192.168.114.1**.

This change immediately went into effect, successfully limiting access to my host machine while blocking others. The **Windows 10 machine** (IP **192.168.1.10**) could no longer access the Security Onion web interface, whereas my host machine continued to maintain access as shown below.

![Access restricted to 192.168.114.1](image_placeholder_here)

This limited access to only **192.168.114.1**, my host machine’s IP address. As a result, other devices, such as my **Windows 10 machine** (with IP **192.168.1.10**), were no longer able to access the Security Onion web interface. Below is an image showing successful access from the host machine while blocking access from others.

![Access restricted to 192.168.114.1](image_placeholder_here)

|LAN (em1) | 192.168.1.254 | Yes | 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.253|
|OPT1 (em2)    | No IP Address configured (used as a Span Port)| Not Required Since it is a Span Port   | Not Required|
|OPT2 (em3) | 192.168.3.254 | Yes | 192.168.3.10 to 192.168.3.253|
|OPT3 (em4) | 192.168.4.254 | Yes | 192.168.4.10 to 192.168.4.253|
|OPT4 (em5) | 192.168.5.254 | Yes | 192.168.5.10 to 192.168.5.253|

It is however imperative to note that a server obtaining its IP address from DCHP  not be wise to do as other clients will be depending on the server for services. 
From the range above, teh reserved IP range for VMnet2 whuch the server recides in is from ```192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.9```.
I will therofre assign a static IP of ```192.168.1.1``` and set the Gateway as the IP of the pfSense and and set the DNS as the server IP with the seconday been that of ```8.8.8.8```
![DNSSetup](files/images/046DNSSetUp.png). The firewall was tunred off and the security also tunred off in order to simulate the attack laer in the project.
The server name was also changed to srv1 and then rebooted for the changes to take effect

I started to add the Active DIrecotry to the Server in order to maek it the Domain Cocntroller.
![Installing AD](files/images/048ActiveDirectoryDomainServicesBeenAdded.png)

After the installaiont i promoted teh server to be a domain controller and then set the Root Domain Name as ```biira.com```
![Setting Root Domain Name](files/images/049SettingRootDomainName.png)
The domain and forest functional levels were set to 2016 for backwak compatibility asn thent the DSRM password set accordingly. it then set the NetBios name as BIIRA which was good. The NTDS and SYSVOL file were kept in the default folders. Below is the script generated which can later be used to do AD promotion to domain controller
```powershell
#
# Windows PowerShell script for AD DS Deployment
#

Import-Module ADDSDeployment
Install-ADDSForest `
-CreateDnsDelegation:$false `
-DatabasePath "C:\Windows\NTDS" `
-DomainMode "WinThreshold" `
-DomainName "biira.com" `
-DomainNetbiosName "BIIRA" `
-ForestMode "WinThreshold" `
-InstallDns:$true `
-LogPath "C:\Windows\NTDS" `
-NoRebootOnCompletion:$false `
-SysvolPath "C:\Windows\SYSVOL" `
-Force:$true
````
I encounted a failur on my first trail due to the fact that i do not have alocal admin passowrd set on the server and hence had to fix that.
![Failed Attempt](files/images/050FailedAttempt.png)
The installation was able to proceed successfuly as the password issue was fixed.
![Fixed Problem with Psswrod](files/images/051FixedProblem.png)
![Installation Completed](files/images/052ServerUpRUnnning.png)

After the isntallation, I created an organisational Unit (OU) called ```CyberMonitoringLab``` with groups and then users which were later added to the group Below is a Video demonstration of part of the activity.
After teh step above, I need to make the active Directory Vulneabrle in order to expose it to many attakcs.
The first thig i did was to doanload a script from a githunb repo that will be run to make the AD vulnearle
Source to the Vulneable Script on gihub is https://github.com/safebuffer/vulnerable-AD
The command below helpe dto download the script called vulnad.pas1
``` powershell 
IEX((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazehell/vulnerable-AD/master/vulnad.ps1"));

```
The script was then invoked to run withteh commnand below. 
```

``` powershell
Invoke-VulnAD -UsersLimit 100 -DomainName "biira.com"
```
![Fake Accounts](files/images/052ServerUpRUnnning.png)
The scripts created lots of users that i did not create first and more details of the script will eb explaine dlater. 

With the installed script, teh following attakcs can now be executed on the Active DIrectroy:
Abusing ACLs/ACEs
Kerberoasting
AS-REP Roasting
Abuse DnsAdmins
Password in Object Description
User Objects With Default password (Changeme123!)
Password Spraying
DCSync
Silver Ticket
Golden Ticket

## Joining Windows10 to Domain
In order to accomplish this, I first change the DNS configuration on the host machine so teh Preffered DNS Server will the IP address of the windpos Server whils the LAternate will be that from google, 8.8.8.8
![DNS](files/images/055SettingDNSforHost.png)
In the systems properties of the Host machine,  changed the name to pc1 and then restarted the machine first before tying to join the domain controller. 

I then changed from work grup to doamin and then inout the domain name as biira.com. I then joined the Administrator first to the domain by inptuing the username and its coreresponding passowrd.

![Admi Joined](files/images/057Joined.png)

In Active DOrectory, it has shown pc1 joined the domain succesfuly.This is located in teh Compputer Group under the domain.

![pc1Joined](files/images/058pc1Joined.png)
I later loggedn in to the windows machine with anotehr user created earlier in Active Directoty

## Installing Splunk in Ububntu Server

I then need to install Splunk on my system by using the short ubuntu command below

``` bash
wget -O splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.3.1/linux/splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb"

sudo dpkg -i splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb

```
Well, i needed to copy and pasete the command above on my Ubuntu Server Terminal but i was having a problem with it so i decided to install the Ubunut GUi with the command ```sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop```
![Ubuntu Desktop Installed](files/images/059UbuntuDesktop.png)


I enable Splnk to start on boot with teh command


``` bash
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start

```

Adminsitrator Name entered is : noble_antwi

Splunk will hten be moved to the opt folder and i can start with the command

``` bash
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
```

The splunik interface is then accessible with the url http://127.0.0.1:8000
In the previois onfiguration, spkunk was cnfigured to be on Vmnet6 and will received an automatic IP which is hte ciurrent case However, Since SPlunk is going to be playing a very imporatnt role int he setup, it has to be on a static IP so  we do not have any confuguration challenges later should the IP change as the Acive Direcotry will be forwarding logs to it as well for monitoring. Since it is on Vmnet6, the IP range The will be 192.168.5.1
he current IP address for hteh UBuntu serever hositng SPlunk is 192.168.5.11/24 obtained from teh pfsense. NB: In the pfsense settings for DHCP it will start leasing IP address from  192.168.5.110 to 192.168.5.253. This ip is on inerface ens32 on Ubuntu Server as shown below
Ther are two ways to make the change of IP. One can be on the server itself or from the pfsense settings. SInce pfsense already has a reserved IP from 192.168.5.1 to 192.18.5.9, i will rather rest the IP on the Ubuntu server itself by first moving to the direcory ```/etc/netplan```. Ahter wjich i will loate teh file ```90-NM-7fa2bb2b-abd5-39d1-a648-0c15abce21ef.yaml``` and open it with sudo command in order to make editing to it. ```sudo nano 90-NM-7fa2bb2b-abd5-39d1-a648-0c15abce21ef.yaml```
The content of the file is 

``` bash 
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens32:
      renderer: NetworkManager
      match: {}
      dhcp4: true
      networkmanager:

        passthrough:
          connection.timestamp: "1729582833"
          ipv6.method: "disabled"
          ipv6.ip6-privacy: "-1"
          proxy._: ""
``` 

WHich i edited to 
``` bash
  GNU nano 7.2                                                                            90-NM-7fa2bb2b-abd5-39d1-a648-0c15abce21ef.yaml *                                                                                   
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens32:
      renderer: NetworkManager
      addresses:
        - 192.168.5.1/24       #static IP and subnet
      gateway4: 192.168.5.254   # Your default gateway
      nameservers:
        addresses:
          - 8.8..4.4           # Google DNS
          - 8.8.8.8            # Google DNS
          - 192.168.1.1        # Domain Controller DNS (added last)
      networkmanager:
        uuid: "7fa2bb2b-abd5-39d1-a648-0c15abce21ef"
        name: "netplan-ens32"
        passthrough:
          connection.timestamp: "1729582833"
          ipv6.method: "disabled"
          ipv6.ip6-privacy: "-1"
          proxy._: ""


```

Static IP (192.168.5.1/24): This assigns a static IP address to the ens32 interface, with the /24 indicating the subnet mask (255.255.255.0). This means the server will use a fixed IP of 192.168.5.1 on the network.

Gateway (192.168.5.254): The gateway4 setting specifies the default gateway that the server will use to communicate outside the local network.

DNS Servers: Three DNS servers are listed:

8.8.4.4 and 8.8.8.8: These are Google's public DNS servers.
192.168.1.1: This is the local DNS server, which is your Domain Controller, added last in the list. The system will use this one if the others don’t respond or if local domain resolution is required.
NetworkManager: This section allows the interface ens32 to be managed by NetworkManager. It includes details like the UUID (a unique identifier) and some IPv6-related settings (which are disabled here).


![Setup](files/images/062StatiIPUbuntu.png)
In order to apply the changes, i hit the command ```sudo netplan apply``` which change the IP Configuration as seen below afyer running the ```ip addr`` command

``` bash

## Configruation on Splunk to Receive Logs and also Indexing for Windows Server

In the video below i use teh opportnity to set up a splunk receining end on port 9997 and alse set up a node(more like a buket) called index to hold the logs that will come from WIndows Server. The name given to the index is  ```windowServerLogs```

## Setting Up Forwarder on Windows Server
In the next step, i need to set up forwarder on the host which is the Domain controller to forward its logs to Splunk for analysYS.
I complterd the downlload of Splunk Enterprise 9.3.1 for Windows on the we website of splnk using the URL https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html#  After the download has comeplted i copied it to the DOmain COntroller and installed it

 In aconfigured the inout.conf file in order for Splunk to see that data using the content 
 ``` powershell

 [WinEventLog://Application]
disabled = 0

[WinEventLog://Security]
disabled = 0

[WinEventLog://System]
disabled = 0

````
I have an explicit video on the set uo below.

### Comprehensive Home Lab Setup for Cybersecurity Testing and Monitoring



---

### Network Design and Segmentation

#### 1. **Security Operations Network** (Better name: **Monitoring/Defense Network**)
- **IP Range**: `192.168.3.0/24`
- **Description**: This network is designated for Security Onion and other related defense tools such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and log aggregation services. It will act as the nerve center for monitoring traffic, analyzing logs, and correlating events across the lab’s networks.
- **Components**:
  - **Security Onion**: (`192.168.3.10`) A platform for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity threats. This instance will capture logs, analyze network traffic, and provide visibility into attack vectors.
  - **Additional monitoring tools**: Other tools like Grafana, Kibana, and ELK Stack can be deployed in the future to provide advanced visualization and data correlation.

#### 2. **Victim Network** (Better name: **Corporate Network/Target Network**)
- **IP Range**: `192.168.2.0/24`
- **Description**: This network represents the internal, corporate-like environment that is simulated for victim systems. It will be the target of attacks launched from the Attacker Network. The key focus here is creating a realistic corporate domain structure with systems such as Domain Controllers, workstations, and potentially other internal services (e.g., file servers, web servers).
- **Components**:
  - **Domain Controller**: (`192.168.2.10`) This acts as the Active Directory (AD) server, controlling user access, group policies, and authentication within the victim environment.
  - **Windows Workstation 1**: (`192.168.2.11`) A standard user machine that attackers might exploit using lateral movement, phishing campaigns, or malware.
  - **Windows Workstation 2**: (`192.168.2.12`) A second machine simulating another user endpoint, used for expanding the environment and testing larger attack vectors.
  - **Potential Expansion**: Additional systems (Linux servers, database servers, etc.) can be added as needed to increase the scope of attack simulations.

#### 3. **Monitoring Network** (Better name: **Log Aggregation Network**)
- **IP Range**: `192.168.4.0/24`
- **Description**: This network contains the key log aggregation and monitoring systems, including Splunk. The purpose is to collect logs from all systems across the lab (Security Onion, victim systems, etc.) and provide a central point for analyzing logs, monitoring events, and correlating them to potential attacks.
- **Components**:
  - **Splunk**: (`192.168.4.10`) A powerful platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data from across the network.
  - **Grafana** (future potential): A real-time analytics tool that provides visualizations of network performance, security events, and system health data, pulling from sources like Splunk or other log collectors.
  - **Scalability**: Other security monitoring solutions can be added to this segment to provide enhanced visibility or to test their integration with existing tools.

#### 4. **Attacker Network** (Better name: **Penetration Testing/Threat Actor Network**)
- **IP Range**: `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Description**: This network is designed to simulate external attackers attempting to breach the victim environment. It is isolated from the other networks but connected via pfSense, which will handle routing and segmentation. The purpose here is to allow the launch of attacks from the attacker environment to the corporate network.
- **Components**:
  - **Kali Linux**: (`192.168.1.10`) The attacker machine used to perform penetration testing, exploit vulnerabilities, and simulate real-world attacks. This machine will utilize tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and others to compromise the victim systems.
  - **Other Attack Tools** (optional): In the future, additional attack platforms (such as Parrot OS) can be added to introduce variability in the attack methods.

---

### Network Design Details

#### **pfSense Firewall and Routing**
- **IP Range**: Each network segment will be routed through **pfSense**, which serves as the core firewall and router, ensuring traffic flows securely between networks. 
- **Firewall Rules**: 
  - **Victim Network**: Strict rules should be in place to prevent unnecessary traffic between the Victim and Attacker networks. For example, the Victim Network should only allow certain types of incoming traffic from the Monitoring Network (e.g., for log collection and analysis).
  - **Attacker Network**: Traffic from the Attacker Network should be limited to predefined penetration testing scenarios.
  - **Monitoring Network**: Traffic should be allowed freely from the Monitoring Network to all other networks, as this network will collect logs and monitor all activity.

#### **Network Security Layers**:
- **Internal Traffic Monitoring**: Security Onion and Splunk will be set up to capture network packets from the different segments and analyze them for anomalies. You can use **port mirroring** on the victim network to allow Security Onion to detect and analyze potential threats.
- **Traffic Segregation**: Ensure all networks (Attacker, Victim, Monitoring) are properly isolated using pfSense to avoid unauthorized access between segments.

#### **Future Expansions**:
- **Additional Victim Machines**: You can expand the Victim Network with more workstations or servers, such as Linux servers, email servers, or web servers, to simulate a more complex environment.
- **Advanced Attack Techniques**: Introduce more sophisticated attack tools or attackers in the future to simulate complex APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks, ransomware infections, or phishing campaigns.
- **Log Aggregation Expansion**: The Monitoring Network can include new tools as you grow your lab, such as **ELK stack** for advanced analytics or **Prometheus** for real-time monitoring.

### Example IP Addressing Scheme

| **Device**                | **Role**                    | **Network**             | **IP Address**        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Domain Controller          | Active Directory Server      | Victim Network           | 192.168.2.10           |
| Windows Workstation 1      | User Endpoint                | Victim Network           | 192.168.2.11           |
| Windows Workstation 2      | User Endpoint                | Victim Network           | 192.168.2.12           |
| Kali Linux                 | Attacker Machine             | Attacker Network         | 192.168.1.10           |
| Security Onion             | IDS/IPS and Monitoring       | Security Operations Net. | 192.168.3.10           |
| Splunk                     | Log Aggregation              | Monitoring Network       | 192.168.4.10           |
| pfSense                    | Firewall and Router          | All                      | 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1 |

---

### Diagram Overview
For visualization, the architecture can be illustrated with a network diagram that represents the four network segments (Attacker, Victim, Monitoring, and Security Operations). This will show how pfSense acts as the routing layer, connecting each segment while ensuring proper segmentation and security controls.

---

### Conclusion:
This lab setup is ideal for simulating a variety of cybersecurity scenarios, including network intrusions, lateral movement, and monitoring of attack behavior. The use of pfSense for network segmentation ensures isolation, while tools like Security Onion and Splunk enable real-time analysis and monitoring. The lab is modular, allowing for future expansion in terms of both network devices and monitoring capabilities.
