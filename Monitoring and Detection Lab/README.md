## Infrastructure Setup

### VMware Installation

VMware Workstation was chosen as the virtualization platform for this lab due to its robust features and ability to create isolated networks. The installation process was straightforward, and the following virtual networks were created:

| Network Name | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| VMNet2 | Internal LAN |
| VMNet3 | SPAN Port |
| VMNet4 | Attacker Network |
| VMNet5 | Security Onion Network |
| VMNet6 | Splunk Network |

These virtual networks provide the necessary segmentation for different components of the lab, allowing for isolated testing and monitoring.

### pfSense Installation and  Configuration

pfSense is an open-source firewall and router platform that offers comprehensive network security and management features. Acting as the central component of the network infrastructure, pfSense plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliable connectivity, secure traffic management, and network segmentation.

#### Interface Assignment

In this setup, a pfSense virtual machine (VM) was deployed with six network adapters, each mapped to a specific VMware virtual network (VMNet). This configuration facilitates robust network segmentation and allows controlled communication between different virtual environments. Below is a detailed description of the setup:

| Network Adapter | VMNet |
|-----------------|-------|
| Network Adapter | NAT |
| Network Adapter 2 | VMNet2 |
| Network Adapter 3 | VMNet3 |
| Network Adapter 4 | VMNet4 |
| Network Adapter 5 | VMNet5 |
| Network Adapter 6 | VMNet6 |

**Network Adapter 1 (NAT):** Serves as the WAN interface for pfSense, connecting it to an external network via VMwareâ€™s NAT service, simulating internet access.
**Network Adapters 2-6:** Each is mapped to a different isolated VMNet, representing separate subnets used for various virtual lab components such as workstations, monitoring tools, and security appliances.

#### Initial WAN Interface Issue and Resolution

Upon initial configuration, the WAN interface (Network Adapter 1) did not acquire an IP address. This was traced to the VMware NAT service being stopped on the host machine. The issue was resolved by restarting the VMware NAT service, allowing the WAN interface to obtain an IP address of 192.168.114.10/24. This IP address was dynamically assigned by the host system, enabling the pfSense VM to connect to external networks.

#### IP Configuration

Each interface on pfSense was configured with distinct IP settings to manage the traffic flow and provide network services:

| pfSense Interface | IP Address | DHCP Enabled? | DHCP Range |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| WAN (em0) | 192.168.114.10 (auto) | No (Acquired from host) | N/A |
| LAN (em1) | 192.168.1.254 | Yes | 192.168.1.10 - 192.168.1.253 |
| SPAN (em2) | No IP Address | No | N/A |
| Kali (em3) | 192.168.3.254 | Yes | 192.168.3.10 - 192.168.3.253 |
| SecOnion (em4) | 192.168.4.254 | Yes | 192.168.4.10 - 192.168.4.253 |
| Splunk (em5) | 192.168.5.254 | Yes | 192.168.5.10 - 192.168.5.253 |

**WAN (em0):** This is the external-facing interface, configured to receive its IP address from the host system via VMwareâ€™s NAT.
**LAN (em1):** Acts as the primary internal network interface, with DHCP enabled to allocate IP addresses between 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.253 for connected devices.
**SPAN (em2):** Configured without an IP address, this interface is used for traffic mirroring, allowing network monitoring tools to analyze and capture packets without being part of the routed network.
**Kali (em3):** Connected to a network segment for the Kali Linux VM, with DHCP providing IPs within the 192.168.3.x range.
**SecOnion (em4):** Used for the Security Onion environment, a network monitoring and intrusion detection system, with its own DHCP pool in the 192.168.4.x range.
**Splunk (em5):** Configured for a Splunk instance to analyze and visualize logs, with DHCP allocating IPs in the 192.168.5.x range.

**SPAN Interface Purpose**

The SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) interface is configured without an IP address to function solely as a traffic mirror. This setup allows it to replicate network traffic to monitoring systems for inspection and analysis, enhancing the labâ€™s capability for security auditing and troubleshooting.

This configuration of pfSense with multiple network adapters mapped to VMware virtual networks creates a versatile and secure lab environment. The segmentation into dedicated subnets allows each connected virtual machine to interact as needed while maintaining strong security boundaries and enabling detailed traffic analysis through the SPAN interface.

#### Firewall Rules Configuration in pfSense

In a lab environment, it is often necessary to configure firewall rules that allow flexibility for testing and monitoring network interactions without restrictions. For this reason, permissive firewall rules were created on pfSense to ensure seamless communication across different network segments. Below is a detailed breakdown of the rules applied to the various interfaces.

#### 1. **WAN Interface Rules**

- **Configuration**: A rule was created to allow all inbound and outbound traffic on the WAN interface.
- **Purpose**: This setup facilitates unrestricted external connectivity for the lab, ensuring that test environments requiring internet access or communication with external services can do so without hindrance.
- **Security Note**: Allowing all traffic on the WAN interface is highly insecure for production environments. In real-world scenarios, WAN rules should be tightly controlled to permit only essential traffic to prevent unauthorized access and potential threats.

#### 2. **LAN Interface Rules**

- **Configuration**: Similar to the WAN interface, the LAN interface was configured with a rule allowing all traffic.
- **Purpose**: This approach simplifies communication between connected devices on the LAN network, making it easier to test services, applications, and network flows without facing connectivity issues.
- **Security Consideration**: For production networks, this rule should be modified to include only specific allowed traffic to protect sensitive data and systems. Best practices involve defining rules that limit access based on IP address, port, and protocol.

#### 3. **Rules for Other Interfaces (e.g., Kali, SecOnion, Splunk)**

- **Configuration**: Each of the other interfaces (em3, em4, em5) was set up with rules allowing all traffic.
- **Purpose**: These permissive rules ensure smooth traffic flow across the entire lab environment, which is vital when testing network monitoring, intrusion detection systems (e.g., Security Onion), or log analysis tools (e.g., Splunk). Full traffic access enables comprehensive testing of security configurations, network performance, and data flow analysis.
- **Security Consideration**: While such open rules are acceptable in isolated lab environments, they pose significant security risks if used in production. In practical applications, these rules should be restricted to allow only necessary traffic. For instance, limiting traffic to specific sources, destinations, or service ports can help minimize exposure to potential security threats.

### Best Practices for Production Use

- **Restrict Traffic**: Replace permissive "allow all" rules with rules that define specific sources, destinations, and allowed services.
- **Use Firewall Aliases**: To simplify rule management, use aliases to group IP addresses or networks and apply rules efficiently.
- **Enable Logging**: Activate logging for critical rules to monitor and analyze traffic patterns for potential issues or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update rules to adapt to changing security requirements and network structures.

### Windows 10 Installation and Configuration

A Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) was installed and connected to VMNet2, which represents the internal LAN segment managed by the pfSense router. This setup serves to validate the network configuration and simulate a typical client environment within the lab.

#### Network Configuration and IP Assignment

- **DHCP Assignment:** The Windows 10 VM successfully received an IP address of 192.168.1.10 from the DHCP server configured on the pfSense LAN interface (em1). This automatic IP assignment confirms that the pfSense DHCP service is functioning as expected and properly managing the 192.168.1.x subnet.
- **Subnet Details:** The LAN interface, em1, is set up with an IP address of 192.168.1.254, acting as the default gateway for devices within this subnet.
  
**Client Machine Role and Connectivity**
**Purpose**: The Windows 10 VM acts as a client machine on the internal network, enabling various use cases such as:

- **Accessing Network Resources:** Testing connectivity to other devices and services in the lab.
- **Network Configuration Testing**: Verifying that the internal network is properly segmented and isolated from other network interfaces.
- **Application Testing:** Simulating user interaction with applications hosted within the lab.
  
**Web Configurator Access:** The Windows 10 VM can access the pfSense web configurator by navigating to *<http://192.168.1.254>.* This allows administrators to make real-time adjustments to the pfSense configuration from within the internal network.
Benefits of This Configuration
Network Validation: The successful DHCP assignment and connectivity confirm that pfSense is properly routing and managing traffic within the 192.168.1.x subnet.
Testing Environment: The Windows 10 client provides a platform for testing firewall rules, connectivity to security tools (such as Security Onion and Splunk), and the overall lab setup.

Thank you for adding more details! Here's the complete, personalized write-up that includes your experience with setting up Splunk, configuring the Universal Forwarder on the Domain Controller, and other relevant sections:

## Installing and Configuring Splunk on Ubuntu Server

Setting up Splunk in my **Threat Detection and Monitoring Lab** was a critical step for centralizing log management and enhancing visibility across the network. I deployed Splunk on an **Ubuntu Server** connected to the **192.168.5.0/24** network (VMNet6) to act as the main platform for log collection and analysis.

### Ubuntu Server Configuration Journey

Initially, my Ubuntu Server was assigned a dynamic IP (`192.168.5.11/24`) by the **pfSense DHCP server**. The pfSense DHCP settings reserved IP leases starting from `192.168.5.10` to `192.168.5.253`, ensuring no conflicts with other services. For stability and ease of management, I reconfigured the server with a **static IP** (`192.168.5.1`), crucial for consistent communication with key infrastructure, including the **Domain Controller** at `192.168.1.1`.

### Installing Splunk: Step by Step

To set up Splunk, I used the following commands:

```bash
wget -O splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.3.1/linux/splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb"
sudo dpkg -i splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb
```

### Overcoming Installation Challenges

To make installation smoother, especially when copying and pasting commands, I installed the **Ubuntu Desktop GUI**:

sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
```

The web interface became accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. To maintain consistent log collection from devices like the **Domain Controller**, I ensured the server retained its static IP configuration (`192.168.5.1`).

### Configuring the Domain Controller to Forward Logs to Splunk

The next step was to set up a Splunk Universal Forwarder on the **Domain Controller** (`192.168.1.1`) to send Windows logs to the Splunk instance for analysis. I downloaded **Splunk Universal Forwarder 9.3.1** for Windows from the [Splunk website](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html#) and transferred the installation package to the Domain Controller.

After completing the installation, I configured the `inputs.conf` file to specify which event logs should be sent to Splunk:

```powershell
[WinEventLog://Application]
disabled = 0

[WinEventLog://Security]
disabled = 0

[WinEventLog://System]
disabled = 0
```

This setup allowed the Domain Controller to forward **Application**, **Security**, and **System** logs to Splunk for in-depth analysis and monitoring.

 I also created a video tutorial showcasing the setup process step-by-step for better clarity.

Certainly! Here's a more comprehensive and professional version of the Active Directory environment setup, focusing on the key details for the cybersecurity lab:

---

## Active Directory Environment Setup

### 1. **Windows Server 2022 Installation and Configuration**

Windows Server 2022 was installed on a virtual machine (VM) and placed within the internal network (VMnet2) for the cybersecurity home lab. The lab architecture is designed to replicate real-world scenarios with multiple subnets and network segments, as outlined in the following table:

| IP Subnet        | Network Connection | Role       | pfSense Interface | VMware Adapter   |
|------------------|--------------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 192.168.114.0/24 | NAT                | WAN        | em0               | Network Adapter  |
| 192.168.1.0/24   | VMnet2             | LAN        | em1               | Network Adapter 2|
| 192.168.3.0/24   | VMnet4             | KALI       | em3               | Network Adapter 4|
| 192.168.4.0/24   | VMnet5             | SECONION   | em4               | Network Adapter 5|
| 192.168.5.0/24   | VMnet6             | SPLUNK     | em5               | Network Adapter 6|

Initially, the server was configured to obtain an IP address dynamically via the pfSense DHCP server. However, to ensure consistency and reliable network performance in a production environment, a static IP configuration was applied to the server:

- **Static IP Address**: 192.168.1.1
- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
- **Default Gateway**: 192.168.1.254 (pfSense LAN interface)
- **Primary DNS**: 192.168.1.1 (self-referential for Active Directory DNS)
- **Secondary DNS**: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS for fallback)

To simulate a vulnerable testing environment, the following security measures were deliberately disabled on the server:

- Windows Firewall was turned off.
- Windows Defender and other built-in security features were disabled.

The server was renamed "srv1" to reflect its role as the primary domain controller (DC), and a reboot was performed to apply these changes.

### 2. **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Setup**

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) was installed using the Server Manager's "Add Roles and Features" wizard. Following the installation, the server was promoted to a domain controller with the following configuration:

- **Root Domain Name**: biira.com
- **Forest Functional Level**: Windows Server 2016
- **Domain Functional Level**: Windows Server 2016
- **Domain Controller Options**:
  - **DNS Server**: Installed and configured automatically.
  - **Global Catalog**: Enabled.
  - **Read-only Domain Controller (RODC)**: Not selected.

A Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password was set to ensure the ability to recover from potential AD corruption or other disaster scenarios.

Additionally, the NetBIOS domain name was automatically set to **BIIRA**, derived from the full domain name **biira.com**. The default paths for the NTDS database and SYSVOL share were accepted:

- **NTDS Database Path**: C:\Windows\NTDS
- **Log Files Path**: C:\Windows\NTDS
- **SYSVOL Path**: C:\Windows\SYSVOL
  
  #### Reverse DNS Lookup Configuration

  Below is an illustration of Reverse DNS lookup configuration.
<video controls src="files/videos/2Configuringdnsreverselookup(4).mp4" title="DNS Reverse Lookup Setup"></video>

### 3. **Creating and Managing Users and Groups**

Once the server was successfully promoted to a domain controller, an Organizational Unit (OU) named **CyberMonitoringLab** was created within Active Directory to organize domain objects for lab-specific configurations and testing. Under this OU, groups and users were created to simulate a typical organizational structure, providing a realistic environment for testing.

### Implementing Vulnerable Active Directory

To create a realistic testing environment for cybersecurity scenarios, the Active Directory environment was deliberately made vulnerable using a script from a public GitHub repository. This approach allows for the rapid deployment of a complex, insecure AD structure that mimics real-world misconfigurations.

The vulnerability script was downloaded and executed using PowerShell with the following commands:

```powershell
IEX((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazehell/vulnerable-AD/master/vulnad.ps1"));
Invoke-VulnAD -UsersLimit 100 -DomainName "biira.com"
```

This script, named `vulnad.ps1`, is designed to create a vulnerable AD environment automatically. The `Invoke-VulnAD` function was called with specific parameters:

- `UsersLimit 100`: This parameter sets the number of fake user accounts to be created.
- `DomainName "biira.com"`: This specifies the domain name for the vulnerable AD environment.

##### Video Illustration of Introduction of Vulnerability

<video controls src="files/videos/3Runningvulnearblescript(1).mp4" title="Running Script to Introduce Vulnearability"></video>
The script likely implemented several types of misconfigurations commonly found in real-world Active Directory environments, such as:

1. Weak Password Policies
2. Excessive Privileges
3. Misconfigured Group Policies
4. Insecure Service Accounts
5. Kerberos Misconfigurations
6. Unsafe Delegations
7. Unpatched Systems
8. Clear-text Passwords
9. Weak ACLs
10. Trust Relationships

### Potential Attack Vectors

The vulnerabilities introduced by the script open up several potential attack vectors that are commonly exploited in real-world scenarios:

1. **Password Spraying**: Attackers can attempt to gain access using common or weak passwords across multiple accounts.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: Misconfigured permissions allow attackers to elevate their privileges within the domain.

3. **Lateral Movement**: Weak segmentation and excessive permissions enable attackers to move laterally across the network.

4. **Kerberos Attacks**: Misconfigurations in Kerberos settings can be exploited for attacks like Golden Ticket or Silver Ticket.

5. **Domain Privilege Abuse**: Overly permissive settings on domain objects can be abused to gain domain admin rights.

6. **Group Policy Exploitation**: Misconfigured Group Policies can be leveraged to deploy malicious scripts or gain system access.

7. **Service Account Compromise**: Weak service account passwords or excessive permissions can be exploited for persistent access.

8. **NTLM Relay Attacks**: Misconfigured systems may allow for NTLM credential relay attacks.

9. **DCSync Attacks**: Improper AD replication permissions might allow unauthorized domain replication.

10. **Forest Trust Abuse**: Misconfigured forest trusts can be exploited to gain access across different domains.

This vulnerable Active Directory environment provides a rich testing ground for various attack scenarios and defensive strategies. It allows cybersecurity professionals to practice identifying and exploiting common AD misconfigurations, develop and test detection mechanisms for AD-based attacks, improve incident response procedures for AD compromise scenarios, and understand the impact of poor AD hygiene on overall network security.

### Joining a Windows 10 Client to the Domain

To complete the AD setup and integrate a client machine into the domain, a Windows 10 system was configured to join the **biira.com** domain. The steps for domain joining are outlined below:

1. Ensure the Windows 10 client is on the same network segment (VMnet2) as the domain controller, ensuring network connectivity.
2. Verify that the Windows 10 client can resolve the domain name **biira.com** using the domain controller as its DNS server.
3. Change the computer name on the client machine if necessary.
4. Join the domain by accessing the **System Properties** dialog (right-click **This PC > Properties > Change Settings > Change**).
5. Enter the domain name **biira.com** and provide domain administrator credentials to authenticate the client machine into the domain.
6. Restart the client machine to complete the domain join process.

After joining the domain, the Windows 10 client was able to authenticate against the domain controller, and domain resources were accessible based on the userâ€™s permissions.

## Security Testing and Vulnerability Simulation

========================================================================================================================

1. VMware
2. Windows 10
![Windows10Installed](files/images/001Win10Installed.png)

1. Installations of pfSense
   Per the topology above, the pfsesne will have 6 interfaces which is idicate below.
   The configuration is.

| Network Adapter   | VMNet   |
|-------------------|---------|
| Network Adapter   | NAT     |
| Network Adapter 2 | VMNet2  |
| Network Adapter 3 | VMNet3  |
| Network Adapter 4 | VMNet4  |
| Network Adapter 5 | VMNet5  |
| Network Adapter 6 | VMNet6  |

![VnetConfiguration of pfsense](files/images/002pfSenseVmNetConfiguration.png)

During the installation process, the first interface to show up in order to configure the rest of the interfaces indicated no IP address configuration for WAN (wan) with interface em0.
Further research on my side showed that the WMware NAT servies running ont he host was stoped hence the insatance was not getting the WAN interface IP address which is the IP.
address it will use to access the internet.  A restart of the Service in services resolves th issue.
In th intial IP assigment. th Wan insterface has an IP ADDRESS OF 192.1868.114.10/24  WHICH IS THE FIRST ip i CONFIGURED IN vmware fOR nat TO ASSIGNT O THE FURST INSTANCE IN THE NETWORK..The configuration can be seen below.

![NATSetup](files/images/005NATSetup.png)

![StoppedService](files/images/003NATServiceStopped.png)

![pfSenseConfiguration](files/images/004InitialIPconfigurationofPfSense.png)

This version aligns the content properly for a clean and readable table in Markdown.

### Configuration of pfSense Interfaces

In the image below the interfaces from WAN to em65 have been assisgned
![InterfaceAssignment](files/images/006AssigningINterfaces.png)
After completing th einterface assigment, all the interfaces are now showing as indicated below:

![All Interfaces Showing in pfSense](files/images/007AllInterfacesShowing.png).

The next thing to do is to set IP addresses and then set all of them. STARING WITH THE lan INTERFACES.
In this step however, I have decided to assign each interfaces the last IP in the ranges i will be using.
I also Enabled http on the LAN in order to access the firewall Graphically.
The URL to access the web configurator is *<http://192.168.1.254>*

| pfSencse Interface | IP Address|DHCP Enabled? | Range of DHCP IP |
|----------- | ----------| -----------|-------------------|
|WAN (em0) | 192.168.114.10 (auto assigned)| Acquired From host | Will Revert|
|LAN (em1) | 192.168.1.254 | Yes | 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.253|
|OPT1 (em2)    | No IP Address configured (used as a Span Port)| Not Required Since it is a Span Port   | Not Required|
|OPT2 (em3) | 192.168.3.254 | Yes | 192.168.3.10 to 192.168.3.253|
|OPT3 (em4) | 192.168.4.254 | Yes | 192.168.4.10 to 192.168.4.253|
|OPT4 (em5) | 192.168.5.254 | Yes | 192.168.5.10 to 192.168.5.253|

Below is the command line interface representation of the assigned IP addresses
![pf Sense Interface IP assignemnts](files/images/008InterfacesSet.png)
As indicated in the table above, the intefcae em2, on th pfsense will be used as a  span port hence no need to assign IP address.

### Creating Firewall Rules with pfSense Web Interface

The Table below will serve as a guide for the set up. The content of the table is an extension from  the one above.

| IP Subnet       | Network Connection | Role   | PfSense Interface | VMware Adapter  |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 192.168.114.0/24 | NAT                | WAN    | em0               | Network Adapter |
| 192.168.1.0/24   | VMNet2             | LAN    | em1               | Network Adapter 2 |
| No IP Address    | VMNet3             | SPAN   | em2               | Network Adapter 3 |
| 192.168.3.0/24   | VMNet4             | KALI   | em3               | Network Adapter 4 |
| 192.168.4.0/24   | VMNet5             | SECONION | em4              | Network Adapter 5 |
| 192.168.5.0/24   | VMNet6             | SPLUNK (192.168.5.0) | em5               | Network Adapter 6 |

Since the pfsense is within the LAN network which is VMNet2, I will put a work station on the same netowrk in order to access the web configurator.
In this case i will use the windows 10 workstation installed earlier. The reserveed IP addresses for the LAN are from, 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.9. Since pfsense have been configured as  DHCP for the lan networkI am expectignt that the windows instance.
will have any IP address from 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.253 and its Gatway will be the LAN IP confifured for the.
pfsense which is 192.168.1.254.

OPening the windows instance indicated to me the instance has been assigned an IP of 192.168.1.10 as can be confirmed from the attached.
image below

![Windows 10 Auto Assigned IP](files/images/009WIn10AtuoAssignedIP.png)

![IP Auto Assigend to the Windows Instance](files/images/010IPAutoAssinged.png)

The web configurator URL as indicated earlier can be assessed via  *<http://192.168.1.254>*
Entering the URL in windows opens up the web configurator as shown below:

In the first web interface set up

1. Hostnmae = pfsense
2. Domain = biira.com
3. Primary DNS: 8.8.8.8
4. Seconday DNS : 4.4.4.4
   ![DNSSetup](files/images/011DNSPage.png)

5. Time Server was kept as the Default. and time change to US central timezone.
6. ALl setttings on the WAN interface was kep as default apart from the option to ```Block RFC1918 Private Networks``` and  ```Block bogon networks``` which were unchecked.

![WAN Setup](files/images/012WANsetup.png)
7. LAN IP is set tp 192.168.1.254 which is correct hence not need to touch anything there as the configuration from the CLI is correct.
8. Admin Password was changed to a preffered one from the Deaful one of pfsense.

Pfesense reloads after the step above and then comes up with the interface in order to now start the configuration.
![All Insterfaces Loaded](files/images/013COnfiguringAllinterfaces.png)

In order for easy compreheions, i will go ahead and rename the Instrafers from the the Deafult ones  as some do not correspond to the Lab configuration

![Default Names](files/images/014DeaultNaming.png)

Some of the interfacenames have been changed as indicated below

Hereâ€™s a table in Markdown format with the headers "Old Name" and "New Name" along with two rows of dummy data:

| Old Name       | New Name        |
|----------------|--------------- |
| OPT1 (em2)     | span           |
| OPT2 (em3)     | Kali           |
| OPT4 (em5)     | SecOnion       |
| OPT5 (em6)     | splunk         |
![New Names](files/images/015NewNames.png)

#### COnfiguring Span

In the Bridges tab, I will then forward all traffic from the LAN port to the SPAN as per the configuraiton

![Lan to Span](files/images/016LantoSpan.png)
![BridgedLanTOSPan](files/images/017DoneBridge.png)

## Installing Windows Server 2022

The windows server 2022 was installed successfuly and placed on Vmet2 which is serving as the internal network as depicted below

| IP Subnet       | Network Connection | Role   | PfSense Interface | VMware Adapter  |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 192.168.114.0/24 | NAT                | WAN    | em0               | Network Adapter |
| 192.168.1.0/24   | VMNet2             | LAN    | em1               | Network Adapter 2 |
| No IP Address    | VMNet3             | SPAN   | em2               | Network Adapter 3 |
| 192.168.3.0/24   | VMNet4             | KALI   | em3               | Network Adapter 4 |
| 192.168.4.0/24   | VMNet5             | SECONION | em4              | Network Adapter 5 |
| 192.168.5.0/24   | VMNet6             | SPLUNK | em5               | Network Adapter 6 |

![WinServer](files/images/045WinServerInstalled.png)
From the IP configuration layout below, teh Server would have obtained its IP addess from pfSense that had already been configured as the DCH server.

| pfSencse Interface | IP Address|DHCP Enabled? | Range of DHCP IP |
|----------- | ----------| -----------|-------------------|
|WAN (em0) | 192.168.114.10 (auto assigned)| Acquired From host | Will Revert|
|LAN (em1) | 192.168.1.254 | Yes | 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.253|
|OPT1 (em2)    | No IP Address configured (used as a Span Port)| Not Required Since it is a Span Port   | Not Required|
|OPT2 (em3) | 192.168.3.254 | Yes | 192.168.3.10 to 192.168.3.253|
|OPT3 (em4) | 192.168.4.254 | Yes | 192.168.4.10 to 192.168.4.253|
|OPT4 (em5) | 192.168.5.254 | Yes | 192.168.5.10 to 192.168.5.253|

It is however imperative to note that a server obtaining its IP address from DCHP  not be wise to do as other clients will be depending on the server for services.
From the range above, teh reserved IP range for VMnet2 whuch the server recides in is from ```192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.9```.
I will therofre assign a static IP of ```192.168.1.1``` and set the Gateway as the IP of the pfSense and and set the DNS as the server IP with the seconday been that of ```8.8.8.8```
![DNSSetup](files/images/046DNSSetUp.png). The firewall was tunred off and the security also tunred off in order to simulate the attack laer in the project.
The server name was also changed to srv1 and then rebooted for the changes to take effect

I started to add the Active DIrecotry to the Server in order to maek it the Domain Cocntroller.
![Installing AD](files/images/048ActiveDirectoryDomainServicesBeenAdded.png)

After the installaiont i promoted teh server to be a domain controller and then set the Root Domain Name as ```biira.com```
![Setting Root Domain Name](files/images/049SettingRootDomainName.png)
The domain and forest functional levels were set to 2016 for backwak compatibility asn thent the DSRM password set accordingly. it then set the NetBios name as BIIRA which was good. The NTDS and SYSVOL file were kept in the default folders. Below is the script generated which can later be used to do AD promotion to domain controller

``` powershell
Invoke-VulnAD -UsersLimit 100 -DomainName "biira.com"
```

![Fake Accounts](files/images/052ServerUpRUnnning.png)
The scripts created lots of users that i did not create first and more details of the script will eb explaine dlater.

With the installed script, teh following attakcs can now be executed on the Active DIrectroy:
Abusing ACLs/ACEs
Kerberoasting
AS-REP Roasting

## Installing Splunk in Ububntu Server

I then need to install Splunk on my system by using the short ubuntu command below

``` bash
wget -O splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.3.1/linux/splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb"

sudo dpkg -i splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-linux-2.6-amd64.deb

```

Well, i needed to copy and pasete the command above on my Ubuntu Server Terminal but i was having a problem with it so i decided to install the Ubunut GUi with the command ```sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop```
![Ubuntu Desktop Installed](files/images/059UbuntuDesktop.png)

I enable Splnk to start on boot with teh command

``` bash
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start

```

Adminsitrator Name entered is : noble_antwi

Splunk will hten be moved to the opt folder and i can start with the command

``` bash
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
```

The splunik interface is then accessible with the url <http://127.0.0.1:8000>
In the previois onfiguration, spkunk was cnfigured to be on Vmnet6 and will received an automatic IP which is hte ciurrent case However, Since SPlunk is going to be playing a very imporatnt role int he setup, it has to be on a static IP so  we do not have any confuguration challenges later should the IP change as the Acive Direcotry will be forwarding logs to it as well for monitoring. Since it is on Vmnet6, the IP range The will be 192.168.5.1
he current IP address for hteh UBuntu serever hositng SPlunk is 192.168.5.11/24 obtained from teh pfsense. NB: In the pfsense settings for DHCP it will start leasing IP address from  192.168.5.110 to 192.168.5.253. This ip is on inerface ens32 on Ubuntu Server as shown below
Ther are two ways to make the change of IP. One can be on the server itself or from the pfsense settings. SInce pfsense already has a reserved IP from 192.168.5.1 to 192.18.5.9, i will rather rest the IP on the Ubuntu server itself by first moving to the direcory ```/etc/netplan```. Ahter wjich i will loate teh file ```90-NM-7fa2bb2b-abd5-39d1-a648-0c15abce21ef.yaml``` and open it with sudo command in order to make editing to it. ```sudo nano 90-NM-7fa2bb2b-abd5-39d1-a648-0c15abce21ef.yaml```
The content of the file is

``` bash
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens32:
      renderer: NetworkManager
      match: {}
      dhcp4: true

          proxy._: ""


```

Static IP (192.168.5.1/24): This assigns a static IP address to the ens32 interface, with the /24 indicating the subnet mask (255.255.255.0). This means the server will use a fixed IP of 192.168.5.1 on the network.

Gateway (192.168.5.254): The gateway4 setting specifies the default gateway that the server will use to communicate outside the local network.

DNS Servers: Three DNS servers are listed:

8.8.4.4 and 8.8.8.8: These are Google's public DNS servers.
192.168.1.1: This is the local DNS server, which is your Domain Controller, added last in the list. The system will use this one if the others donâ€™t respond or if local domain resolution is required.

In the video below i use teh opportnity to set up a splunk receining end on port 9997 and alse set up a node(more like a buket) called index to hold the logs that will come from WIndows Server. The name given to the index is  ```windowServerLogs```

## Setting Up Forwarder on Windows Server

In the next step, i need to set up forwarder on the host which is the Domain controller to forward its logs to Splunk for analysYS.
I complterd the downlload of Splunk Enterprise 9.3.1 for Windows on the we website of splnk using the URL <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html#>  After the download has comeplted i copied it to the DOmain COntroller and installed it

 In aconfigured the inout.conf file in order for Splunk to see that data using the content

 ``` powershell

 [WinEventLog://Application]
disabled = 0

[WinEventLog://Security]
disabled = 0

[WinEventLog://System]
disabled = 0
